# Project Overview

This project consists of five primary Python scripts that facilitate the scraping, analysis, and visualization of restaurant reviews from Zomato:

1. **Zomato Review Scraper (`zomato-review-scraper.py`)**
   - This script retrieves restaurant reviews from the Zomato website.
   - It saves the collected reviews as CSV files in the `Reviews` subdirectory.

2. **Sentiment Analyzer (`sentiment-analyzer.py`)**
   - This script processes the CSV files from the `Reviews` directory to perform sentiment analysis on the individual reviews.
   - It generates two output files for each restaurant:
     - `{restaurant_name}_sentiment.csv`: Contains sentiment scores for each review.
     - `{restaurant_name}_aggregate.csv`: Provides aggregated overall sentiment scores.
   - Both output files are saved in the `Sentiments` subdirectory.

3. **Dashboard (`dashboard.py`)**
   - This script utilizes the individual sentiment CSV files generated by the Sentiment Analyzer to visualize sentiment data.
   - It presents the aggregated sentiment analysis through interactive visualizations, including a bar graph and a word cloud.
   - The dashboard allows users to filter and explore the sentiment analysis results in a user-friendly format.

4. **Sentiment Visualizer (`sentiment_visualizer.py`)**
   - This script is currently redundant, as its functionalities have been integrated into `dashboard.py`. It can be removed or archived for potential future use.

5. **Main (`main.py`)**
   - This script serves as the entry point for the project, orchestrating the execution of the other scripts based on user input.
   - Users can select which steps of the workflow to execute, allowing for greater flexibility in the data processing pipeline (e.g., skipping certain steps if data has already been processed).

## Workflow Summary
1. **Data Collection**: Run `zomato-review-scraper.py` to collect reviews and save them in the `Reviews` directory.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Execute `sentiment-analyzer.py` to analyze the reviews and generate sentiment output files in the `Sentiments` directory.
3. **Data Visualization**: Launch `dashboard.py` to visualize
